 ## 🛠 Tools & Techniques Used
 
- MS SQL Server – Data querying and preparation  
- Power BI Desktop – Report development and visualization  
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Calculated columns and measures  
- Conditional Formatting – Enhanced visuals for top/bottom performance  
- Slicers & Page Navigation – User-friendly interactive dashboard

## 🔄 Process Followed

- Data Extraction - Queried pizza sales data using - MS SQL Server 
- Data Cleaning & Transformation - Removed duplicates, handled nulls, standardized data formats  
- Data Modeling - Established relationships between fact and dimension tables in Power BI  
- Measure Development - Created custom DAX measures for KPIs like revenue, order value, etc.  
- Visualization - Built visuals using charts, tables, cards, and slicers  
- Interactivity & UX - Implemented Page Navigation, Tooltips, and Conditional formatting

## 🧗 Challenges Faced

- Data Cleaning & Formatting in SQL - Ensuring consistent date formats and handling missing or duplicate values required careful SQL transformations.
- Complex DAX Measures - Building dynamic KPIs like average order value and pizzas per order with DAX involved a learning curve, especially around filter context and row context.
- Slicer Synchronization Across Pages - Implementing consistent slicers across multiple Power BI pages using page navigators took time to configure without breaking interactivity.
- Visual Overload Avoidance - Balancing visual richness with clarity was a challenge—deciding what to highlight without overwhelming the viewer was crucial.
- Performance Optimization - Large datasets slowed down visuals. Learning to use summarization techniques and reducing visuals per page improved responsiveness.
